## 2026-08-23 — Public docs, privacy policy, private doc set

- Added `/docs` — public methodology page explaining the four method principles, how a brief
  is structured (title → provocation → contents → Unresolved → depth control), the depth-control
  levels in plain terms, and a "what we deliberately don't do" trust section. Paper ground,
  matching the reader treatment used for briefs and the Primer.
- Added `/privacy` — privacy policy covering what's actually collected (email on
  subscribe/waitlist, the four Studio commission-form fields, order data on future checkout,
  standard Cloudflare server logs), why, which processors touch it (Supabase, Resend,
  Cloudflare, Razorpay/Stripe once live), retention, and a deletion-request path via
  `privacy@aroha.study`.
- Header nav grew from 3 items to 4 (`Research · Studio · Vision · Docs`) at the user's explicit
  request. This is a deliberate, acknowledged deviation from the source spec's "three nav items
  maximum" rule — see IMPLEMENTATION.md § Deviations from spec.
- Footer nav gained `Docs` and `Privacy` links.
- Started this private doc set (this file, TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md,
  DOCUMENTATION.md) at the user's request, plus `CLAUDE.md` at repo root instructing future
  sessions to keep all four current on every change.
- Known gap surfaced, not fixed yet: the Studio commission form collects no reply-to contact
  (project / deadline / budget / question only, per the original spec's literal four-field
  instruction) — so as built, Aroha has no way to reply to a commission request unless the
  requester happens to put contact info in the free-text question field. Flagged in
  IMPLEMENTATION.md; not fixed in this session since it wasn't in scope of the ask.

## 2026-08-22 — Cloudflare deploy fix (OpenNext + Wrangler)

- First deploy attempt failed: Cloudflare's build pulled `dd39dad` (the pre-existing Gemini
  scaffold commit) because the Phase 1 build below had never been pushed — `npm run build`
  failed with `ENOENT package.json`.
- Added `@opennextjs/cloudflare` + `wrangler` as dev dependencies, `open-next.config.ts`,
  `wrangler.jsonc` (worker name `aroha`, `nodejs_compat` + `global_fetch_strictly_public`,
  assets binding).
- Hit an infinite-recursion bug: `defineCloudflareConfig()` from `@opennextjs/cloudflare`
  silently drops unknown top-level keys (including `buildCommand`) — it only forwards
  `incrementalCache` / `tagCache` / `queue` / `cachePurge` / `enableCacheInterception` /
  `routePreloadingBehavior`. Pointing `package.json`'s `build` script directly at
  `opennextjs-cloudflare build` therefore made the adapter's internal `npm run build` step
  call itself. Fixed by keeping `build` as plain `next build` and adding a separate
  `pages:build` script (`opennextjs-cloudflare build`) for the Cloudflare-specific bundle.
- Verified locally: `npm run pages:build` completes clean, `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`
  resolves the config and the `env.ASSETS` binding without needing `wrangler login`.
- **Action required from the human owner** (no dashboard access from here): change the
  Cloudflare project's Build command from `npm run build` to `npm run pages:build`.
- Committed and pushed to `origin/main` (`risabh1234/ARK`) — commit `03dada6`.

## 2026-08-22 — Phase 1 build from the Design.pdf spec

- Context: a prior Gemini session had created the GitHub repo (`risabh1234/ARK`) and a local
  Supabase scaffold (`supabase/config.toml`) with a placeholder README. The user pointed to
  `~/Desktop/Design.pdf` as the actual spec to build against.
- The PDF turned out to be a full "Aroha — Design & Go-to-Market Specification" (11 numbered
  sections), not a simple mockup — positioning, exact colour tokens, type scale, grid/motion/
  texture rules, component specs, verbatim page copy for four pages, a Supabase schema, a
  funnel/revenue model, and a prescribed stack. Extracted via PyMuPDF at high zoom (the PDF's
  vector content was scaled into a ~38pt-wide strip inside an A4 page — unreadable at normal
  render resolution, legible only after cropping/zooming per-band).
- Built the full spec: design tokens (`tailwind.config.ts`, `app/globals.css`), primitives
  (`Header`, `Footer`, `Button`, `EmailCapture`, `Primitives.tsx`, `ReadingProgress`,
  `DepthControl`, `BriefRow`, `CommissionForm`), and the four pages (`/`, `/research` +
  `/research/[slug]`, `/studio`, `/vision`) plus `/primer` (the free asset), copy verbatim from
  the spec where the spec gave verbatim copy.
- Backend: Drizzle schema (`subscriber`, `order`, `commission_request`) + matching hand-written
  SQL migration, `/api/subscribe` and `/api/commission` routes. Both degrade gracefully (log a
  warning, don't throw) when `DATABASE_URL` isn't set, so local dev never breaks without a live
  backend.
- Explicitly *not* built (matches the spec's own "Phase 2 — do not build any of it tonight"
  section): the hosted reader with real depth-control gating, saved questions / per-reader
  library, the knowledge-graph visual, Codex cohort onboarding, Studio case pages, and — beyond
  the spec — live Razorpay/Stripe checkout, Turnstile, and R2-backed PDF delivery (all scaffolded
  in `.env.example`, none wired to real credentials).
- Verified via `npm run build` + `tsc --noEmit` (clean) and `curl` against a local `next dev`
  server for all six routes (200s, headings match spec copy verbatim). Could not get a real
  browser screenshot — this sandbox's network policy blocks the Playwright/Chromium CDN download
  (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`), and no `chromium-cli` binary was available.
